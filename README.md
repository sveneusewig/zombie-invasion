You control a survivor of a disaster who fortunately found refuge behind a barricade. Once there, he has to defend his life with a found firearm against waves of incoming zombies. This requires skill and fortune. If a zombie makes it over the wall, you lose one life point. As time goes on, bigger waves of zombies await and it becomes harder to survive. Stay alive.
